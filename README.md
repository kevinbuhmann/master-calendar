# master-calendar
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kevinphelps/master-calendar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kevinphelps/master-calendar)

This is a project is a [hackathon submission](https://hackhelpforbigs.devpost.com/).

> Within the agency there are multiple events, internal & external, that are documented in multiple
places. Events could be anything from a program event for Bigs & Littles to a donor reception or a
ticketed event to our new space, ANEW.

`Master calendar` is a visually appealing real time calendar with event tagging built with
internal/external access controls in mind.

**Realtime updates**: This app is powered by a realtime database which means everyone viewing the
app will see the latest info available. Automatically.

**Event management and access control**: This app enables the management at Big Brothers Big Sisters
of Eastern Missouri to view, filter, sort, and manage all of the events going on and scheduled
organization-wide in a single place.

**Event filtering and sorting**: Events can currently be filtered by a single event tag, single
event type, or match on both an event tag and event filter. But more advanced queries and even text
search is possible in the completed app.

**Access control**: In the completed app, events can have different audiences based on event tag,
event type, and/or event location. Organization administrators would be able to allow each user
access to a certain slice of the calendar, so internal groups, mentors, parents, etc. would be able
to view the events they are invited to attend. A slice of the events could also events be made
available for public view.
